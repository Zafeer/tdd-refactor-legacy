# Refactor-Legacy + TDD

This repository is a collection of **Test-Driven Development (TDD) Katas** and **Legacy Refactoring Katas**, designed to sharpen skills in writing clean, maintainable, and testable code. The repository is structured to cater to both beginners and experienced developers looking to refine their coding and refactoring techniques.

## Objectives

- **Promote TDD Practices:** Encourage the habit of writing tests before implementing functionality.
- **Refactor Legacy Code:** Improve the structure and quality of existing codebases without changing their external behavior.
- **Enhance Problem-Solving Skills:** Provide hands-on exercises to tackle real-world coding challenges.

## Contents
