# Refactor-Legacy + TDD

This repository is a collection of **Test-Driven Development (TDD) Katas** and **Legacy Refactoring Katas**, designed to sharpen skills in writing clean, maintainable, and testable code. The repository is structured to cater to both beginners and experienced developers looking to refine their coding and refactoring techniques.

## Objectives

- **Promote TDD Practices:** Encourage the habit of writing tests before implementing functionality.
- **Refactor Legacy Code:** Improve the structure and quality of existing codebases without changing their external behavior.
- **Enhance Problem-Solving Skills:** Provide hands-on exercises to tackle real-world coding challenges.

## Contents

### 1. TDD Katas

These exercises are aimed at practicing TDD principles by building solutions incrementally with tests. Examples include:

- **FizzBuzz Kata**
- **AgeCalculator Kata**
- **String Calculator Kata**
- **EvenDigit Kata**
- **RockPaperScissors Kata**

### 2. Legacy Refactoring Katas

These exercises focus on improving poorly written code while preserving functionality. Examples include:

- **Expense Report Generator Kata**

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zafeer/tdd-refactor-legacy.git
   cd tdd-refactor-legacy
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment:**
   Install the necessary dependencies for Typescript (i.e. NodeJS if not already installed).
   Preconfigured with linting and formatting

   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

3. **Pick an Exercise:**
   Navigate to the desired kata directory and follow the README for specific instructions.

4. **Write Tests:**
   Start by writing failing tests, implement functionality, and refactor iteratively.

5. **Run Tests:**
   Use vitest to verify your solution:
   ```bash
   npm run test:watch  # JavaScript/TypeScript
   ```
